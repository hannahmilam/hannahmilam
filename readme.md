## Hello!

My name is Hannah. I am currently attending Boise Code Works to get my full stack software developer certificate. I have a passion for coding! My background previously was in the dental industry which I am still very passionate about. 

In my free time whent he weather permits I love to paddleboard down the Payette River, hike in the mountains, fish, and spend time with my family.
