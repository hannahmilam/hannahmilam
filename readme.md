## Hello!

My name is Hannah. I am currently attending Boise Code Works to get my full stack software developer certificate. I have a passion for coding! My background previously was dental practice management. I am a dedicated and passionate student working hard towards my future as a software developer.

In my free time whent he weather permits I love to paddleboard down the Payette River, hike in the mountains, fish, and spend time with my family.
