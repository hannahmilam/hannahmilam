PEOPLE I REACHED OUT TO:
I reached out to several people that, mostly our classmates, staff, former students, but also people who work at in time tec and allata. 
MESSAGE DRAFT:
My message I sent to one person (I tried to personalize it with each person) was 'Hi (persons name), I'm Hannah. I'm graduating from Codeworks in November. I saw that you just got a job at Allata! That is so exciting. What has been your favorite part about software development so far?
PEOPLE I WANT TO GIVE ME A RECCOMENDATION:
I asked my former employee Nikki. She was a hygienist at the dental office I worked at to be give me a recommendation. She gave me one this morning. I tried to find past employers or coworkers on indeed, but have not heard back from them yet in order to ask. I would like my former boss who is a dentist as well as an oral surgeon I used to work for leave me a recommendation in addition to the one I received from Nikki.
